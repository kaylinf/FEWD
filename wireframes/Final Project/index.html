				<h2>Cafe Lulu</h2>
				<div>
					<p>Located just a few miles from the airport, train station and downtown in the trendy Bay View neighborhood of Milwaukee, this is an ideal first stop for anyone just getting into the city. Lunch fare includes a variety of sandwiches, wraps, flatbreads and salads, but the reason people continue to come back is for their famous sides &mdash; homemade chips and blue cheese sause and asian slaw!</p>

				<h2>Lakefront Brewery</h2>
				<div>
					<p>
						While there is no shortage of beer-centric activities in the Brew City, Lakefront Brewery offers an entertaining tour &mdash; really, their guides are pretty hilarous &mdash; several pints of any of their craft beers and the option to eat at their restaurant &mdash; make sure you get the cheese curds. All for $8!
						<br>
						<br>	
						Oh, and did I mention it is rated the 4th best brewery in the country?

				<h2>The Packing House</h2>
				<div>
					<p>
						While most people know that Sconnies love and need their cheese, the Friday night fish fry is a lesser known institution to people outside the midwest. But if you happen to be in Wisconsin on a Friday night you have to partake in the fish fry and The Packing House is the place to go. Consistently rated as having one of the best fish frys in the city, this place is a Friday night must. But don't worry, if you over do it at Lakefront beforehand, they are also pretty famous for their fish fry.
